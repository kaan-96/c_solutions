## Exercise 6
Repeat Exercise 5 for C99.

### Solution
(a) 8 % 5 = 1</br>
(b) -8 % 5 = -3 (since -8 / 5 = -1, we get -8 - (-1 * 5) = -3)</br>
(c) 8 % -5 = 3 (since 8 / -5 = -1, we get 8 - (-1 * -5) = 3)</br>
(d) -8 % -5 = -3 (since -8 / -5 = 1, we get -8 - (1 * -5) = -3)

Note: See solution to exercise 5 for clarifications.
