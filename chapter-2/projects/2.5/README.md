## Project 2.5
Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for *x* and then displays the value of the following polynomial:</br>
3*x*⁵ + 2*x*⁴ - 5*x*³ - *x*² + 7*x* - 6</br>
*Hint:* C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiply *x* by itself repeatedly in order to computer the powers of *x*. (For example, `x * x * x` is `x` cubed.)
### Solution
See `2.5.c`.
