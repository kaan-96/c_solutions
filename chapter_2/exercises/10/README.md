## Exercise 10
In the `dweight.c` program (Section 2.4), which spaces are essential?

### Solution
See `10.c` for a rewritten `dweight.c` which only includes essential spaces (excluding line breaks and spaces in strings).</br>
Essential spaces are between `int` and `main(void)`, between `int` and the first subsequent declared variable, and between `return` and `0;`.
