## Exercise 4
Write a program that declares several `int` and `float` variables—without initializing them—and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values? (Usually there isn't.)

### Solution
See `04.c`.
The output doesn't show any discernible pattern:
```
0, 16, 600
0.000000, 0.000000, -9829114707978948069205999616.000000
```
