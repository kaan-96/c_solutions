## Project 1
Write a program that calculates how many digits a number contains:
```
Enter a number: 374
The number 374 has 3 digits
```
You may assume the number has no more than four digits. *Hint:* Use `if` statements to test the number. For example, if the number is between 0 and 9, it has one digit. If the number is between 10 and 99, it has two digits.

### Solution
